_**Doug:**_ So today we have Martha Bueno, who’s sitting over here. She’ll be on stage in just a moment. She’s running for a local office down here, she’s a Candidate for Commissioner, and she will tell in detail in her talk. In a year I was here for another conference representing Monero at the North American Bitcoin Conference, and that was interesting a lot of shoot pointery and NFT stuff over there, but I met Margaret Bueno, and she was interested in Monero, and she’ll get into why, and I’ll leave it at that. Martha without further ado get on the stage.

_**Martha:**_ Good morning all here. How is everyone today? […] I’m a Candidate for Commissioner in a district out far away, nothing to do with where we are right now, but if you are local in Florida somewhere I have petitions that I have left used but I do not give the United States government another dollar I want to get on the ballot by petition […].

So, first of all watch this. “One revolution is still necessary: the one that will not end with the rule of its leader. It will be the revolution against revolutions, the uprising of all peaceable individuals, who will become soldiers once so that neither they nor anyone else will ever have to be a soldier again”. 90 miles from our shores lies a country where there is no liberty, where the simple act of saying that you don’t agree with your government can land you up to 20 years from here, where growing your own food is an act of rebellion. This place I’m talking about is where my parents are from. It’s where my grandparents were born and raised. Even trace my generation, my family’s generations back on both sides of my head.

A place that was once the wealthiest and most prosperous nation in Latin America. I’m not speaking about a mythical place, we’re thinking about an island that is literally 200 miles from us right now, closer to us than our state property. That place is Cuba.

[…] Enough of this regime whose leaders live in wealth while the country starts enough with the forced exile of over 2 million. Enough of the lies and propaganda produced by the inner government to pretend that the reasons why he has faced difficulties in the United States is the rock game. Enough of the lie like humans has a medical marble, meanwhile the average human can’t even get an aspirin.

The reality is that Cuba is a slave island, and I don’t say that likely. The regime which consists of the heirs independence and a handful of others, decide the fate of 11 million people. Those who are empowered with comfortable lives with a net worth of over 900 million dollars. His family in Cuba drive fancy cars, they travel around the world, and they’re guaranteed high-paying government jobs, for example, multiple Castro’s family members are in the central committee of the communist regime, the communist party. They call the shock for millions of people while everyone else lives in misery. So why am I telling you this?

I’m here to remind all of you why we’re here, why all of this matters. That reason, that thing that brings us all here today is freedom. We all want it, we all know how vital it is for the rest of our lives, because without freedom we have nothing. Plain and simple.

Everyone here I believe fundamentally understands that the government controlling our currency is not conducive to freedom. The state deciding what we can and can’t do with our bodies, or how we can defend ourselves and with what, does not make us any freer. Canadian truckers recently showed us that governments will decide whom to whom and for what reasons we can send our money. We are here because we recognize that we want freedom, and we don’t just want freedom for ourselves. We want freedom for the entire world. And while many cryptocurrencies have good and bad sides, the privacy built into Monero has a tremendous value for human freedom. Right behind me have article 143 of the Cuban Penal Code, and it states that whoever supports, encourages, finances, provides or receives, or has in possession funds, material financial resources with the purpose of defraying activities against the state, incurs a sanction of deprivation of freedom for four to ten years. This is huge of why Monero is so important so vital. And I get this a lot from Bitcoin maximalism. They're like: no Bitcoin is the future of Cuba, and no, it’s not. It’s not because of this law right here. And if anybody in that community is willing to spend four to ten years in jail, then they are by all means continue to do this. But it is important to us that people in Cuba are protected. It’s important to me, it’s of the most importance.

So many of you here might not be up to date on what’s going on in Cuba, and I promise I’m not going to get into the weeds of it. But I would be remiss if I didn’t take this opportunity in front of all of you guys to talk about my island for just a second. And you might be surprised to know that even though I just called it my island, I’ve actually never stepped foot into Cuba. I’ve never been able to walk at streets, swim in its oceans. I have never been able to go there. And even though I can trace my lineage back generations there. My oldest brother was born there. I’ve never had the opportunity to go.

My grandparents who stayed behind when my parents left died decades ago, actually I think we skipped a slide, but it doesn’t matter okay. I never got the opportunity to hug them or grow up with them, hear their stories. I do think about them quite a bit. And then this is my other set of grandparents who left. They came to Miami to wait it out, you know a lot of people here if you come from other countries you also came to the United States to wait it out, wait until things get better back in the homeland. And I remember my grandfather telling me almost on a daily basis: “Martha, I’m only here until Fidel dies, and then I’m home”. My grandfather passed away 18 years ago without ever being able to go back home. But I feel like I’m the lucky one.

You see my father was a political prisoner in Cuba. He was given a six-year jail sentence for the crime of attempting to leave, just got caught trying to leave his country. He realized there was no future, and he just wanted to get out. A year into his jail sentence my mom broke him out of jail. Kind of she’s my hero. On his next attempt to leave Cuba he made it to the US naval base in Guantanamo, where he was received by a soldier who said: “Welcome to America”. And so I’m the lucky one. Back in Cuba I have the rest of my family everybody who couldn’t get out: my aunts and uncles, my cousins. And so I can compare my life directly to the life of my family in Cuba. I’ve been able to start my own business, I’ve been able to raise my children, I’ve been able to go to bed every single night without ever once thinking: will I be able to feed my kids tomorrow. Not once has I crossed my mind. My family back in Cuba not the same. As a matter of fact if it wasn’t for my family here in the United States supporting my family in Cuba, they wouldn’t be able to eat.

And so what is the difference between my life here and theirs there? Freedom. The freedom to do the things that I want to do. So if you’re here in this audience, I believe that we have this in common. I believe that at some point you’ve been red-pilled enough. At some point you’ve taken some inventory of the life around you and you’ve said: “You know, what make government just really isn’t doesn’t have my best interests at heart”. I know, I certainly did. And everyone’s journey down that rabbit hole is a little different. But what I can tell you, the one thing I know with every fiber in my body is that cryptocurrencies will revolutionize the world. Specifically I believe that Monero is the key to unlocking Cubans freedom. And that is a big claim to make, so let’s get into that.

First let me tell you how people all over the world are directly contributing to the regime that is killing people, that is keeps them in misery, and they don’t even know about it. And I am certainly guilty of this and it is called remittances. That is the number one thing we do for people on the island, we give them remittances. And as much as that regime and their useful idiots here in the United States like to complain about the embargo, the United States is the number one source of revenue for the Cuban economy and the Cuban regime. Thank you.

There are nearly 2 million Cuban exiles all around the world sending money back to their families in Cuba every single month. Here in the United States we have 1.3 million Cubans making us the third largest diaspora in this country behind Mexico and El Salvador. This is Cuba’s GDP — 20.5 billion dollars of which 6.6 billion corresponds to remittances in cash and merchandise, 6.4 corresponds to the slavery, the salary, I’m sorry, of medical professionals abroad which is slavery, next one, and 7.5 billion corresponds to tourism and exportable items. Turns out Cuba’s best export is Cubans.

When I talk about Cuba inevitably somebody will be like: Martha what about the embargo? So that’s I can only say that the Cuban government has done an amazing job with their propaganda, which actually might make that their best export but anyways. I digress here you can see the United States is one of the largest exporters of food and medicine to United States to the tune of 323.5 million dollars. Cuba on the other hand only sends us 2.9 million dollars. But the only embargo that is happening in Cuba right now is the embargo the Cuban government has on its citizens.

So back to how do we topple a dictatorship, there are actively right now lots of groups working on boycotts for hotels and travel to Cuba. It’s a great cause and I ask anybody listening to this: please, please, please, please, please don’t go to Cuba. You want to go to Caribbean Island, there are so many of them, beautiful ones. Please skip Cuba for now.

Cuba exports their medical professionals. This is a whole other topic, but it basically boils down to slavery. The doctors travel to countries that pay the Cuban regime for their services, their passports are confiscated, and it’s confiscated so that they don’t flee of course, and the government sells services for thousands of dollars a month. Countries pay thousands, three, four, five, six thousand dollars for a doctor, but that doctor receives less than nine hundred dollars a month in salary. And that’s if they’re lucky. Again they must leave their country, and they take their passports, and they’re forced to perform, they’re literal hostages.

So finally those pesky remittances. And here is why I believe Monero is the tool that has Cuba has been waiting for. Remittances currently work in one of two ways: money is sent either via mules who travel to Cuba and take cash and goods, and this is a preferred method, this is the way that right now people prefer to send money, and it’s the only way to kind of, sort of go around the government, around the regime. The other way is to use CubaPay or RevoluPay, if anyone follows me on social media, you know, I’ve made a big deal about CubaPay, because it was going to be featured at another conference, so because Cubans must exchange their dollars for euros, or euros for their worthless currency, for the MLC or the peso, to be able to buy things, the Cuban regime has control of all of the stores, has control of absolutely everything.

So in order to get Monero to work we are going to need a two-prong approach. The first one is we need mass adoption. And that can happen very easily. The average Cuban makes less than forty dollars a month, a five dollar to download a wallet, great incentive. So we actually can make this happen very quickly. The other thing we’re going to need is a place where people can buy things. So they’re going to need to be able to use Monero somehow, not only just exchange it for cash, they’re going to need a platform. I envision something along the lines of an ebay, where people can list their items and have it sold in Monero. And that’s really great because those remittances that we send, we can send them to those wallets in Monero. So it’s a very easy way I believe to just go ahead and adopt it.

And since Cubans are fleeing the island in mass right now, it should be really easy. They’re desperate to take whatever they can with them, they’re desperate to sell their items, because they make it to these other countries without a dollar in their pockets. They can’t leave Cuba with things, they can’t leave Cuba with money, they can’t leave Cuba with their clothing. So if they can sell everything in Cuba and take something back, something that is digital, that they don’t have to actually carry, and that when they get to that country, they will have access to some form of money, whether it be the country’s currency or Monero. That would be amazing for them, it solves a huge problem. They can access their money, their currency anywhere in the world.

The other reason why Cubans will want to adopt Monero is because they will be able to buy items being sold by those Cubans leaving. Those Cubans that are leaving want to sell their things, but everybody else is looking for things it’s very hard to find, just the basics in Cuba.

Oh, we went a little too far. Back there we go. So what we need, we need education in Spanish. I have been scouring the internet and I found a few good places, a few good resources, but we need more and we need it in easy ways for people on the island to access it. Internet and electricity are a little tough sometimes, so we need something that is easy. We also need Monero, we need the money to incentivize people to download the wallet, and we need as I said a free market platform. So it’s pretty easy. At some point we’ll also need a way for them to mine, but that’s too far down the line.

So I hope every one of you recognizes the face behind me. If you have not signed a petition for Ross, it’s at freeross.org, petition I urge everyone to sign it. Ross Ulbrict had a dream to create a free market platform, and with that he gave Bitcoin its very first use case. He is one of the reasons why we are all here today. So obviously I’m not comparing myself to Ross, but like Ross I have a dream to free my island. And I hope that we can give Monero its first case use on how to topple an authoritarian regime.

So if you’d like to donate Monero for the cause of Cuban freedom, this is the wallet that I’ve created as well as the privacy key for transparency. Any and all funds will be used to spread the adoption of Monero in Cuba. Thank you very much. Patria y vida.

_[Applause]_

If anyone has any questions, you here? Otherwise I hand it back to Doug. Are there any questions? No. Underneath it is the wallet address. Yes, there's nothing in it currently, I hope to change that very soon. Thank you.
