_**Moderator:**_ All right guys, so we're moving on to kind of Monero in the future here. So we've talked about the protocol under the hood, now Adam’s gonna kind of talk about some, you know, theoretical potential futures for Monero in terms of whether or not it is quantum resistant, whether or not it needs to become quantum resistant, and whether or not I guess that's even possible. So go ahead, take it away.

_**Adam:**_ Cool. Well, thank you for having me. So my talk is, of course, on Monero post-quantum, that's the title, and it's going to be mainly three parts. The first part is just going to be introduction to a couple of concepts, including quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and then I’m going to go into the Monero quantum audit a little bit and which was done in 2020, 2021, when it was a while ago, so there might be little things that might have changed since then, but I think for the most part the basic concepts are the same. So there are a few little things in it that are maybe a little applicable today, but most of the stuff is like, you know, looking either like far ahead of the future, just like even currently, if such a thing like quantum computing existed now. Anyway, so with that, let's get into it, okay.

So, quantum computing. It's an introduction to this, I mean that's up here is a wave function, you know, you have basically like a particle beam, and then you have slits, then you have either, you know, observed, not observed. And so you can see the difference between classical computing and quantum computing is. Of course, you know, you have classical bits which could be either zero or one, and you have qubits which could be in a superposition of multiple states. And so there's qubits, there's qutrits. Back when I was reading textbooks on it, which was only three years ago, they were all about like qutrits and qubits are the same, but lately there's actually been some theoretical, you know, discoveries made that could actually show that qutrits might actually be more viable than qubits. But anything a classical computer can do, a quantum computer can do plus a little bit more, they’re faster for certain applications is the main thing, intense parallelism. Basically you have qubits, the main thing is you can entangle them, and then you can just do these like really insane operations, which you do an operation on one qubit and then it affects all the other ones instantaneously. So that's incredible, you know, it violates what's called the Church-Turing hypothesis. And of course I can generate non-deterministic randomness, which is, you know, useful. Next slide.

“If computers you build are quantum then spies everywhere will all want them. Our codes will all fail and they'll read our email till we get crypto that's quantum and daunt ‘em”. Jennifer and Peter Shor. It's a poem in one of the quantum computing textbooks I read. Peter Shore is a person who, if you know anything about quantum computing, you've probably heard the magical thing they can do is Shore's algorithm, which is Shore’s factoring algorithm, which is basically a hidden subgroup problem, you know. It's a generalized thing and solving the discrete log problem is one of the, you know, the basis of Shore’s factoring algorithm. And of course solving the discrete log problem would, you know, the Monero relies on elliptic curve cryptography, protocols, and that would be able to be solved in, you know, polynomial time, so really quickly, and so that basically destroys a lot of secrecy. But anyways that's getting ahead of myself in this talk.

The next thing is Grover search algorithm. Grover search algorithm is I mean… These all basically go from like either like, these most algorithms in quantum computing either go from either using a quantum Fourier transform, which is can be made a lot faster, or using a search algorithm. And so Grover's algorithm is basically a needle in a haystack type of deal. You basically have like one value, let's say you're trying to find like a nonce for a Bitcoin block, and so you go through all the different possible nonces, and you could do this, you know, usually take n over two on average tries, or, you know, that you get really lucky the RNG is in your favor, and you just randomly get it the first try, and or yeah. But with so with Grover's algorithm you basically just have all the entries kind of in superposition that you do some amplitude trickery, and then you get you know eventually the value in square root of quadratic time instead.

And then there's of course the other algorithms such as the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, Simon's algorithm and many more. There's a random access oracle algorithm which, you know, there's not much info on that, but that has some really interesting applications that I haven't really been very explored. But Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm is interesting because it's like you can, you know, set up a system of linear equations with a quantum computer, solve them classically, and you can reduce crazy stuff like reverse block ciphers and stuff, which could be useful for like finding pre-images of hash functions, and anyway. So next slide.

So new vulnerabilities. So really getting into it, how powerful are quantum computers, how fancy are they, how fancy are these fancy computers. Well for Shore’s you can see right here we have like, you know, normal trying to find, you know, this is like several ages of the universe to find, you know, someone’s private key. And here it's like basically like ten seconds. So it's really fast. And how many qubits do you need for this? So in the technical paper we wrote, I did an implementation of Shor's algorithm, and I described the appendix of it of, you know, some implementation of Shore's algorithm that could be used for solving elliptic curves, and it's something like 512 qubits. Potentially if they're non-noisy, it could range from anything from like 512 to like 10 000. But anyway, so compute time for discrete logs can go down from like ten thousand years to seconds, depending on a couple of different factors.

And then for Grover’s, I mean there's a couple of theoretical hurdles with being able to do this, which I won't get into but, you know, theoretically if you had a AntMiner that was using Grover’s to search through, you know, possible nonce values, you can mine a Bitcoin block every day in a second, which would be pretty crazy. But there's other technical hurdles, such as you would probably not be able to get, a clock time that fast with a quantum computer because it uses microwave relay stuff. If you really want to get the actual technical aspects of quantum computers work, I’m happy to answer a couple questions.

And so differential cryptanalysis is the last thing, and that also not included here as well as random access oracle, which is something I've got like I don't remember there, but you know, getting into a bit more technical stuff, and this could be used to do differential cryptanalysis. And there's an exponential speedup with that. So you're either getting quadratic or exponential speedups. And so with exponential speedups you usually get some very game breaking stuff but with like quadratic it's more just like make things a little bit more simple, and you can actually use conjunction of, you know, Grover’s and the quadratic speedup in conjunction with the exponential speedup and that adds a bit more, you know, things that can be explored in terms of vulnerabilities introduced. The next slide.

Okay, so, I’ve said here, post-quantum cryptography. There's a couple different fields right now, and there's more, it's a very all, this is a very rapidly advancing field within the three years since I've been directly involved in it. It's quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. I have just been in this crazy arms race, and I mean there's actually been a lot of space protocols that have been introduced, that like later two years someone was like: you can use a quantum computer to break that lattice based protocol. But for the most part lattice based problems are you know PQ hard and assumed to be BQP as well, I’m sorry MP hard, yeah sorry. I’m forgetting my complexity classes. So then you have super singular curve isogeny based, which is also actually… so these would probably be some of the two most likely candidates, if you wanted to switch to like some post quantum Monero protocol. And then there’s multivariate based, but actually recently there's a paper exposing the multivariate might be a little. So this is like basically just using lattices, lattice based, you know, finding a point on the lattice, super singular elliptic curve isogeny based, I mean this is the equation for finding points on an elliptic curve, isogeny is essentially, and then multivariate you know like have a chaotic system and you… some stuff with that. And then hash-based, and there's actually a Bitcoin well, you know, similar to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency protocol that uses a hash-based already, which is quantum-resistant, which is an extended Merkle signature scheme, which is basically have a Merkle tree, and then you basically can verify a signature that way, and you can build an entire, you know, blockchain that worked that way and still have traded crypto tokens that way. And then of course this quantum-based cryptography, which is way far in the future, which is using quantum computers themselves as nodes in a blockchain network, which would be pretty interesting. So with BB84 for instance you basically have completely… unless you want to try to violate the laws of physics or break quantum mechanics in some way, it's completely secure cryptography anyways. So next slide.

All right so this is probably a little bit of the work we did, this is I wish maybe up a little bit more, but as you can see, we basically what we did was we looked at like the different features in Monero. I don't know if Triptych, it should have it down there, but I don't know if that was finished since then, but we looked at that as well. But we looked at a couple of different aspects, the mechanisms that we were like, okay, well if you did like Shore’s on it or like, you know, discrete log stuff magic with quantum fancy computers that, you know, break things, yes in a lot of cases, that's the main thing that breaks things. Grover’s algorithm, you can use conjunction of Shore’s and Grover’s to actually do some mainly it provides a lot of things we found out along with a fishing and then quantum access to random oracles is also a pretty… yeah that also provides some problems as well, but as you can see it the main thing is Shore’s. Everything else actually, the proof of work mechanism is surprisingly resistant. So that thing where I was saying how like AntMiner with you know Grover’s would be able to just mine Bitcoin every nanosecond wouldn’t be the case for Monero. So it's a little bit more secure than other cryptocurrencies in the event of quantum apocalypse or whatever anyway. So next slide.

So as, you know well, I shouldn't say “urgent”, because it's probably a bit more further in the future, but obviously out of all the things, of course, the main thing is it’s possible to extract private wallet keys from on-chain data. So a couple of other things though is that what something would possibly be able to do violate signer ambiguity, breaking binding of Pedersen commitments, brake Bulletproof range proofs, colliding transaction identifiers by like, yeah I mean, it basically breaks a lot of stuff. A lot of it, some of it actually relies on this thing that I was saying earlier, quantum access to random oracles for Schnorr sigs. The thing with that is there’s not a lot of papers on quantum access to random oracles, but it seems that it is a possibility that could be leveraged. So yeah. To be continued. Proof of work surprisingly secure, as I said, Keccak resistant Grover’s and quantum differential group analysis, so it's a good hash function to use, proof of work surprisingly secure. And in the case of this happening where everything’s on fire it’d still be probably a better thing to put head your bets on them. Most other cryptocurrencies or, you know, even bank account, banks cells probably would not be the best bet to put money into in this case. But, okay, next slide.

Oh yeah, there is a little bit. So yeah how feasible are post-quantum alternatives right now. Well two years ago in this case, because that's when this table was made. Surprisingly they're not that bad in some cases. They're still you could probably could build an entire network all of them at these things. But honestly these numbers have gone down, and the yeah things, certain things have gone up. So as you can see right here like for Monero sig proof sizes is like, at least when this was done, this was like 0.25 kilobytes, but then you have like RingRainbow, by the way RingRainbow actually in a very recently recent paper like three months ago supposedly has very, this is a multivariate scheme, it has like very horrible flaws. It might have to be fixed. And then we have the public key size. This is very big, but then you’ve got some smaller ones down here out there. Raptor-512 is a lattice-based one. Generation time is feasible. If the verify time is also pretty feasible for Raptor-512. Yeah, so things, you know, it’s not as impossible as you might think. Maybe wait a little while, but this is written two years ago, and already things are much more, you know, feasible in terms of that. Anyways, next slide.

So summary of the audit. Current Monero protocol is highly vulnerable to known quantum algorithms, mainly Shore’s, which is, you know, kind of what we expected going into this. The main thing is which is a little iffy is like possible retroactive denomination, which is probably something to think about, like okay let’s say you bought jelly beans from Steve 10 years ago, and the government really doesn't like that or something, or and if Jeff Bezos happens to have a quantum computer in his secret underground volcano lair or something, and he finds out that he sold those jelly beans to Steve and, he's like: “Oh no!” I don't know, so that’s something to consider.

So potentially low-hanging fruit that can be fixed easily now. But anyway so possibly retroactive denomination relies upon quantum access to random oracles which is still a little iffy to some degree, but it's still, you know, possibility. So some potentially low-hanging fruit that can be fixed easily now. Quantum resistant range proofs potentially… yeah we could make some range proofs, that might be a little bit easy to fix, switch commitments and then restrict blinders, these might be actually interchangeable. I didn't really look into that very too deeply when I made this slide. And then stick to using one-time private keys of course, as a given if you already haven't been doing that. But if you weren’t using one-time private keys, I think it might like a while ago, that might be a bit more vulnerable like to retroactive deanominization. But yeah I think in any case you probably should just be doing that anyways if possible. Anyways, next slide.

All right the fun part: speculations. Currently blockchain, so yeah, quantum resistant ledger is a blockchain protocol which currently uses XMSS hash based cryptography, so it's quantum resistant. And it, you know, it’s around… so even if it turns out someone had a quantum computer today or tomorrow, or yesterday, you know, there still would be blockchain, a blockchain available right now. A lot of people… and I’m sure more post quantum projects will probably spring up as time goes on. So but there is one in any case then there’s noisy intermediate skill hardware, IBM has stated 120 qubits machine sometime by like next year, I believe, if they haven't already done that. And they've made a road map before the end of the decade to have a thousand qubits which is like pretty surprising to have that like publicly available. And like I said 512 is basically the point where potentially you could, you know, use Shore’s to break a discrete log cryptography or, you know, hidden subject problem. Potentially that we’re looking at like 512 to like 10 000 cubits is kind of within like the range of that. And then what you're using qutrits is a whole other game. And so quantum advantages are being utilized on a commercial scale using noisy intermediate scale hardware. So this is basically we’re just seeing like basic commercial applications, you know, like you know combinatorial optimizations, you know. It’s a little bit more efficient to run certain programs on quantum computers than classical computers like on like a so like commercially speaking. So it costs more money to run it on a supercomputer than to run it on a quantum computer in a few small cases. So it is finding some industrial applications which is really interesting like right now. More examples of quantum supremacy are demonstrated by experimental hardware like every year. So this is like stuff that a classical computer couldn’t do in ten thousand years sort of a deal. And different examples to keep on, but not nothing too extreme in my knowledge, at least yet, that’s publicly available at least.

And then new post-quantum crypto is constantly being developed. Key size and compute time continue to go down. Post-quantum crypto is of course in an arms race with, you know, quantum computing, and so it's kind of back and forth, but yeah a lot more protocols are being built off of it as well. And you could probably do atomic swaps with a lot of space cryptography at some point too, I don't know. Timeline: quantum computing threat ranges anywhere from three years to three decades, I would assume, you know. Since capabilities are known, you know, at some point if you're using, you know, not quantum, post-quantum cryptography should probably switch at some point. And I mean if we really want to look at the endgame of this, not just for Monero but like any other cryptographic protocol, you should probably implement it a blockchain that uses it at some point hard fork or something, I don't know. Long term what would a quantum cryptography blockchain even look like. And by that I mean, if you use basically the same thing of decentralized consensus where each node is a quantum computer, and each quantum computer is basically sending communications to each other, and they're using like basically huge qubits, which have like basically completely foolproof cryptography, and you can do a bunch of really other fancy stuff as well, like take for a moment just like imagine that world, like it's really interesting to think about like the quantum internet. It's a real thing that could potentially happen within our lifetimes, which is interesting. Yeah, next slide.

There we go: conclusions. So quantum mechanics could be wrong, quantum computers might all be a hype pipe dream. Most likely the threat is real, you know. We're in a great speed right now where we know the capabilities quantum hardware and have time to switch to known resistant cryptography for continued secrecy and safeguarding. There could be a black swan event in which, you know, tomorrow, suddenly the internet’s gone, you know, like that in a very extreme example. And there could also just be examples where it’s just like, you know, we find out that like: oh, some stuff is no longer secret. But you can't really predict that. I mean you can try to make predictions of three years from now or ten years from now, three decades from now, or not in our lifetimes, you know. And then like really, if you really want to look at like I’m gonna for here for a second here get really skeptical about all this. Okay, what if it’s just, all just like you can’t even like, there’s like two there’s two main things, actually three main things: strong Church-Turing hypothesis violations, it’s kind of like: oh, well this seems to violate a very fundamental law of computer science to some degree, but I mean the strong Church-Turing hypothesis, the second thing is it could be that capability is solid state physics, that there could be technical hurdles, installed physics that are just like really, you know, it turns out that it's actually a lot harder to do certain things than not. And that’s why I’m saying, if it publicly available it’s found out that 120 qubits are easily possible, non-noisy cubits, then it’s kind of like that's a big technical hurdle, that it's going to grow exponentially from there. But there could be things with that, and then lastly there could be just like really ridiculous. Quantum mechanics could just be a completely flawed theory, you know, it could be breakdown at certain points that we don't know about yet. I mean physics is one of the most tested theories within, you know, our knowledge over a hundred years, but I mean some people are like: maybe if you have enough like qubits in a room, in a box, and a computer put them all together, and it collapses into a black hole, you know, which is a possibility given information theory. And so yeah imagine for a second what like if it would be real though like barring these possibilities. Everything else that's kind of held up to skepticism, the fact that we're using it for commercial applications right now, my money is on that, it's going to develop further, because people are making money off of it. So anyways it would be really disastrous if it just, you know, Shore’s algorithm capable quantum computer came out. Okay, last slide.

_[Applause]_

No, and then I have one more slide with references if you're curious for what I've been saying, so I’m not talking out of my ass there you go. I think one of these things if you really want to look at the technical implementation of 512 qubits for breaking elliptic curve cryptography, I think it's one of these here, I’m not entirely sure, which one. No, it’s not that one. I don't know, you can look through all those references. Oh, a question already, someone needs to pass him a mic, I mean you can also yell really loudly.

[…]

Yeah also these aren't all the references I’m talking about. Either well yeah I guess I'll open up this to questions. Anyone have any questions? Yeah, oh that guy.

[…]

Physics and astrophysics from UC Berkeley, yeah I took some of the first quantum computing classes there, so I have a well yeah I double majored in astrophysics as well, and then I got involved in this project, I mean I probably should have told it from like that the storyline perspective of like, you know, hearing about the talk… I basically did a project on, you know, Grover’s algorithm to, you know, potentially like mine a theoretical small version of Bitcoin, and then kind of grew from that. And they're like: Oh, wow, this is actually real. You can literally go to IBM Quantum Experience and just run open source hardware on your own for fun with like five qubits. All the cool kids are doing it. Any other questions? Once, twice, thrice. All right, I'll be available for a little bit for questions if anyone’s interested. Who’s next?

_**Audience:**_ Thank you.

_[Applause]_
