_**Doug:**_ Yeah, take it away.

_**Nam:**_ Thank you, Doug. So I have to say I’ve been feeling a really good energy here. I haven’t gone to the Bitcoin Conference, but I’m sure everybody will agree. I went last year. This year I decided not to go.

So I want to say thanks to the organizers, to Doug and Sunita, to the sponsors. And I wanted to say how excited I am to be here presenting in front of all of you. My name is Nam, Nam Sardar. I’m the founder and CEO of Neel Capital. It’s a company that creates and manages cryptocurrency portfolios for investors. I began the company in late 2021, so it hasn’t been that long. Prior to that I used to work in the financial industry. I have been in roles spanning, you know, private equity, asset management, project management. So I’ve been an analyst sort of role in the financial industry for a long time. I feel like crypto is the future, is the future of the financial industry as well, not just the future of digital or electronic payments, I think it’s going to be a lot more than that. It’s one of the reasons that I got into it full time.

So let’s begin. Today’s presentation is targeted towards… I know that the audience that we have here is quite aware about blockchain, proof of work and a lot of the concepts that revolve around cryptocurrency, but my presentations more towards like a novice investor or somebody looking to understand how to navigate the current environment that we’re in. So before we begin, before we go into the slides, I want to ask you all to take a second and close your eyes and imagine two bowls of soup. Please, close your eyes and imagine two bowls of soup, okay? It’s the kind of thick, nutritious soup that you would have for dinner. The soup itself is dinner, like it’s a very thick, heavy soup. One of them is liquid, so it’s got a thick, gravy like liquid. It can be vegetarian or it’s meat, but it’s a thick liquid. The other one has chunks of vegetables in it, or if you eat meat it’s got meat pieces, and it’s just got chunky stuff in it. Very highly nutritious chunky vegetables. Let’s just say it’s a vegetarian soup. So there’s the second soup has a little bit of liquid in it, but it’s mainly solid pieces. The first soup is all liquid. Now think of a little drip of water, like a little jug that continuously pours water in these two bowls of soup, like you get a few drops of water trickling into your soup every day. So you wake up every morning and the soup has risen a little bit in volume. Like it looks like you have more soup, okay. So with this picture in our minds, let’s just part this aside for a second, and let’s get into the slides.

I want to talk a little bit about what’s happening at the geopolitical level. The Ukraine and Russia situation, and then the post pandemic situation, and then we go further into why Monero makes a good investment. So, next slide, please. Next slide. Next.

So Russia is right now in all of the mainstream media — we’re hearing about Russia, Russia, Ukraine and all of this stuff. Let’s look at what on a geopolitical level, you know, what impact all of us could feel from this whole situation, because when something’s in the mainstream media, it’s meant to impact our lives in some way or the other. So let’s try and figure out what that could be. Russia is a commodity superpower. If you see this chart, more than half of its exports are petroleum and petroleum derivatives like fuel oil, diesel, jet fuel, all that stuff. The other half is actually natural gas and gas-based derivatives, so fertilizers and agricultural products. In addition to that it’s also the second largest producer of cobalt. Cobalt is a prime ingredient of our prime raw material of electric vehicle batteries, EV batteries. It’s also one of the largest producers in the world of gold. So any disruption in the supply of these commodities, which is currently happening with all the sanctions, will have and is having a spike in commodity prices, because Russia is such a big producer. So my personal understanding is none of this is accidental. Yeah, next slide, please.

So we’re seeing soaring energy costs around the world, but more specifically in Europe. You can see on this charts, I’m gonna run through this so I don’t take up too much time, but basically that what’s happening right now is because of the sanctions you’re seeing crude oil and its derivatives, like nafta of jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, everything else has gone up in a hockey stick pattern as well. Next, please.

Another thing that Russia exports heavily is agricultural products, it’s the world’s largest producer of wheat. And if you look closely Ukraine is in the top five countries that export wheat as well. And wheat happens to be a pretty staple agricultural, you know, commodity that a lot of the developing countries consume in heavy quantities, like all kinds of bread is made with wheat. So on the other side you see a list of countries, and these happen to be low income countries, some of them are 100 dependent on Ukraine and Russia for their wheat imports. This is a percentage, and you can see that a lot of these countries have almost complete dependence on these two countries, on Ukraine and Russia. So the disruptions are going to be felt very heavily in certain parts of the world. Next slide, please.

The next slide just shows us how the agricultural products prices have shot up as well. Wheat and ammonia which is a main fertilizer that comes from natural gas. So both natural gas and ammonia prices have shot up in again hockey stick patterns. Another fallout of the war or of the conflict right now is the de-dollarization trend. So with sanctions what we’re seeing is a lot of countries that are trading with Russia are moving away from dollar-based payments for commodities. So over the last few weeks a lot of this has already taken place. India is in talks with Russia to arrange a ruble-rupee based payment system. Saudi Arabia has said to China that, you know, they’re ready to accept yuans for their crude oil. European supplies sold to Europe will be based in rubles, and so on and so forth. The common trend is that the world is moving away from the US dollar. And that’s going to accelerate over the coming years. The trend is unlikely to reverse. So this is something that’s a fallout of this conflict.

The next, the next geopolitical or macro level discussion that we can have is about this pandemic, and what has happened during and after it. So there are four main consequences of the pandemic, or well actually of the money printing that occurred during the pandemic. So as we all know, I’m pretty sure you all know, that they printed double the amount of US dollars over the last two years as existed before. So for example you had a hundred dollars in the system, they printed another hundred or more than a hundred. So they doubled the US dollar supply in two years which is pretty crazy, if you think about it, the dollar started back over 100 years ago. So here are the four main consequences of the post pandemic money printing. The first one is we have everything bubbles. Everything bubbles are all this rise in prices that we’re seeing. It’s affecting real estate stocks and bonds. I’ll go into each one in more detail. We have a thing called the inversion of the yield curve that has happened. We have a global cost of living crisis. And we have unsustainable sovereign debt to GDP levels. So let’s go into each one.

So strange, chart looks charming. The everything bubble is what economists are calling the current situation that we’re going through. And I’ll go into a little bit detail. So back in 2000 when we had the dot-com crash we had a stocks bubble. It only impacted equity prices. Any company that had a dot-com was inflated in valuations, and eventually everything crashed. Then we had the next crisis in 2008 and 2009, which was considered a real estate crisis or the housing crash. What happened was stocks were inflated, but real estate was also heavily inflated. Banks were making, you know, funky financial products out of real estate mortgages and selling them to investors. And then everything blew up. Now what we have is the everything bubble. Why? Because we have inflated stocks, we have inflated real estate prices, and we have inflated bond prices. So let’s go into the bond part, because the bond part is the newest part. So, it’s fine, that’s fine.

So when a government issues a bond, the government is basically borrowing money. Now you and I can lend that money to that government, and when the government borrows the money for a longer duration, they have to pay higher interest on that borrowing. And when they borrow money for a shorter duration, they pay a lower interest on that borrowing. So nobody borrows money for free. I’m not going to give my money to the US government, to a 10-year treasury, and then not expect an interest rate back. However what’s been happening in the last few years is the yields, which is the interest rate on bonds, have dropped. They’ve, you know, I mean you might have noticed that your bank pays you less than one percent or like half a percent, or even less than that, to keep your money in the bank. So what happens is when you have low yields in the market, imagine the bonds that the government sold 10 years ago. So let’s say the government sold a 10-year bond back in 2010 and it had a six percent interest rate. Now the government’s supposed to pay you your interest every year or every six months depending on what kind of bond it is. And then the final face value is paid at the time of maturity. So when you have a situation, when the yields drop, which we have been living in for the last few years, it makes those bonds that were issued at higher interest rates more attractive. I’m not sure if you’re following, I hope you are, but, okay, thank you, so when you have these expensive bonds, when I say expensive bonds it means high interest rate bonds issued in the past like 10 years ago, 15-20 years ago, which carry a very interesting interest rate, like a six percent, and you’re coming into an environment where rates have really crashed, and it’s gone closer to zero percent, or let’s say the long-term bonds right now are two, two and a half percent compared to six seven percent a few years ago, then you come into a situation where these higher interest bonds become very expensive and investors want to go after those bonds in the secondary bond markets. The largest financial markets in the world are bond markets. They’re not even the stock markets. So my point is that we have a bond bubble right now. Apart from the real estate and the stock bubble, and I’ll go into all the bubbles one by one. Could you go back? So this is the M1 and this is the M2. I just wanted to finish this part because I didn’t even touch the graph. So M1 is cash and currency and it’s checking accounts. And M2 is M1 plus savings, money market funds, and term deposits. So M2 is actually the real indicator of how much money there is in the economy. And because the M1 shot up over the last two years, you see that hockey stick over here, the M2 has gradually gone up as well. And we’re at unprecedented amounts of, you know, currency flooding the system. So let’s move forward.

So what happens when they’ve printed all this money, and they’ve given it to a lot of the banks, and everybody of us got a stimulus check for 1400 or something like that, but they’ve printed enough money so that everybody could have got, I don’t know 20, 30, 40, I don’t know a lot of money, 40 000, 50 000 each person. So where has all that money gone. It’s gone to prop up a lot of these stock prices. So this is a very famous indicator actually, this is used by Warren Buffett. He loves this indicator because it’s measuring a composite of the stock market value versus the country’s GDP. And we see that at the end of 2021 the composite stock market value of the entire stock market in the US has crossed 216 percent of the US GDP. So let’s say the US GDP is one, the stock market valuations in totality are more than 2.1x of that number, which is kind of crazy. Next slide, please.

So these are some of the valuation multiples, I’m not sure you can see them from there, but generally when companies are valued you use multiples like price to equity or enterprise value to ebita. And when I entered finance, we used to see a high a multiple in the high teams, like a 15x or 18x and we would be like: oh, my god, that’s so expensive, don’t go near that. But you’re seeing multiples that are close to 40x today for some of these sectors. And you have a 56x for renewables companies. A real estate is going at 17x ebita revenue. I’ve never seen multiples like this. In fact using revenue to measure, you know, a company’s valuation is actually a new practice that has come in the last few years. So I just wanted to give you an idea of like how, you know, extreme the valuations have become lately. So you can go to the next slide.

So when we talked about the bonds, how we also have a bond bubble right now, and we talked about how when the government borrows money, they have to pay a higher interest rate for a longer term borrowing, so if the government borrows for 10 years they have to pay you a higher rate, than if they borrow for two years. So the indicator that is usually used to measure this in yield curve inversion is the 10 minus 2. So what’s the yield on the 10-year bond minus the yield on the 2-year bond. And normally, in normal market circumstances, the 10-year bond yield should be higher than the 2-year bond yield, because when the government says “I want your money for 2 years, I’ll give it back to you in 2 years with interest”, you’re not expecting as much interest as if the government says “I want your money for 10 years and I’ll pay you back after 10 years”, then you need a lot more interest to lend your money to the government right. So that’s the normal market circumstances. But what we’re seeing right now is there’s so much uncertainty in the market that the 2-year yields have spiked above the 10-year yields. And when that happens you know that the investors are shaking and they’re saying “I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow”, so I need a higher interest rate to lend you money for the 2-year. So historically this indicator has been used when, or it’s something to note, just before a recession, if you see these yellow shaded areas they’re all recessions in the past, and you want the 10 minus 2 to be a positive number, because generally you would say “I need to pay a higher interest to my lender if he’s lending to me for 10 years versus if he’s lending to me for 2 years”. So that positive number is not positive anymore. This is the zero line, and we’re seeing that though over here, we’re seeing that this 10 minus 2 is either close to zero or it’s actually zero right now, as of a few days ago. And this is the current yield curve, except this is a few days old, but what has happened now is this 10 years is slightly lower and this 2 years is slightly higher. That means the yield curve has inverted. And when the yield curve inverts, a few months later a recession follows. Next one.

So the next impact of this pandemic is a cost of living crisis. If you can raise your hands, please, to let me know if you notice things getting expensive around you. I think all of us feel it right? Everything is going up. We’re a little more reluctant to eat out, we’re a little more reluctant to, you know, make unnecessary expenditures. The cost of living crisis is here. And the measure that the government likes to use to measure the cost of living increase is something called the “consumer price index”, the CPI, except the measure is quite flawed. And I’ll tell you, I’ll give you two reasons why it’s quite flawed. The first one, whenever you’re measuring an increase, you need a stable base value. The CPI is measured in US dollars, and the US dollars are not constant. They’re printing them like crazy. So when you have an unstable base value, there’s no way to measure and increase. So that itself is should completely dequalify or disqualify the CPI as a measure of inflation, but they continue to use it. The second reason why it’s not a good measure is a lot of the goods that were in the basket of goods back in the 80s, 65 percent of those goods and most of them are housing food and energy related, they have been taken out of it. So I mean I don’t know anybody who doesn’t use housing food and energy. I think we all use it every day right, rent or mortgage, or whatever it is, we need to live somewhere, everybody needs a roof over their heads, we need energy to go from place to place, or to heat our homes, or whatever, and we all eat food every day. So those are like important reasons why the CPI is basically a pointless metric. And if you even if you look at the flawed metric that it is, you’re seeing that earnings have not kept up with this sort of suppressed number that they try, that they like to issue. The 7.9 that just came out, it’s not a 7.9, we’ve all seen your favorite ice cream has probably doubled in price, and fruits in the grocery store are like 30 percent higher, everything has gone up way more than what they’re telling us. So a better indicator of cost of living increase is the average home prices. All this information comes from the FED’s website. So I don’t think this whole chart is visible, but the number is actually closer to 500 000, so that’s the value of an average home in the US right now. An average, not a high, not a low, it’s just the average, median home selling, home sale price. And the median income right now is below 70 000, a median household income. So for a median household to purchase the median home at the median savings rate, which is 6.4, it would take them approximately almost a hundred years to pay off that home. So, and I’m obviously that’s happened now, after this pandemic, so that’s another reason why we’re entering some pretty, I don’t want to be a bringer of bad news, but things in the in the macroeconomic space are all pointing towards, you know, a major recession that is incoming. Could we go to the next slide.

Okay, this chart is showing the sovereign debt to GDP levels. So when we talked about the stock market being inflated, and then we talked about the inversion of the yield current talked about bonds, this is those bonds, governments issue bonds to get money, to fund their projects. And Japan is obviously the highest indebted country. The US is over here at 130 plus percent. And most of these countries in the world are above 100 percent, some of these are 200 plus. So we’re seeing a situation where not just the US but pretty much any country in the world is struggling with it’s the amount of debt that it has versus the GDP that they’re producing. The 133 for the US basically means that their debt is 133 percent of their GDP. So that’s a pretty high number as well. If you go to the next slide we can see that that’s basically an unprecedented level. We’ve never had such high dept to GDP. It’s around 30 trillion right now. Next one.

So let’s come back for a second to the bowl of soup, the two bowls of soup. There was a trickle of water, that was trickling into both the bowls right? One of them was liquid, the other one had pieces of, chunks of vegetables in it. Now what happens is when you have a slow trickle of water coming into the bowl, the liquid soup, the soup that’s all liquid, the level starts rising, and rising, and rising, and at some point that liquid starts overflowing and starts spilling out. The other bowl that had a lot more, you know, chunky like veggies in it, the vegetables remain in the bowl. So the water trickles into the other bowl as well, except the liquid part of that bowl, you know, it spills out, but the vegetables remain in the bowl. So now we’re going to talk about what the vegetables are, and what the liquid is. If we go into the next slide…

So this is an investable assets universe. I’ve put the fungible items in green and the non-fungible in red. Now I’m pretty sure this audience has no issue understanding what fungible and non-fungible is, but for the wider audience that doesn’t, you know, come from this background, fungible… well actually I’ll go into that a little bit later. Let’s just go through one by one, gold and silver are, you know, they are fungible assets, and their self-custody asset, they are bare assets, whoever holds them, owns them. So this black line separates the self-custody or the bare assets from the non self-custody assets. So gold and silver are something you can hold, and they’re fungible. Watches, diamonds, artwork, NFTs — I’ve clubbed them together because they’re all unique, collectibles. And then within the crypto space we have Bitcoin, which is obviously the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but it’s also a non-fungible cryptocurrency. They’ll tell you something else, that we got the conference across the street, but the reality is it’s not fungible. And that’s the reason I’m actually at this conference, and not yet as the other one. So Monero’s the market leader in the fungible cryptocurrencies, even at its low market cap. Here we have the separation of the the non-self-custody assets, real estate, residential, commercial, agricultural. None of it is fungible. So it’s in red, because every piece of land, every property is different from the next. Stocks bonds, financial instruments again non-fungible. Commodities like crude oil, like wheat, like corn, like barley or like copper, or whatever, they’re fungible. If you specify the qualities and then, you know, they’re traded in futures and forwards financial markets, and they’re basically interchangeable for each other, but they’re non-custody assets. Nobody gets oil delivered to their home right. If I buy so many contracts of oil they don’t come to your house, you settle that in cash. So yeah so this is basically the investor’s options — when we think about where can you as an investor put your money. The one thing that I haven’t included here is cash. Cash is obviously the liquid asset that allows you to quickly go in and buy whatever you want to convert your cash into. But cash is also, coming back to the bowls of soup, cash is that liquid first bowl of soup, which spills out when the water trickles into it. The other bowl of soup had a lot more chunky vegetables in it, and they didn’t spill out of the bowl, you still had them. You maintained the nutritional value of that soup, because your soup was converted into those, you know, chunky pieces of meat or vegetables, that didn’t lose or they didn’t seep out of your bowl, when the water trickled into it. So I didn’t know of any other way to make it simple, the concept of inflation, that’s why I thought of the two bowls of soup. But yeah, let’s go into the next slide.

Now we come to cash. The liquid soup was all cash. Cash sitting in the bank account is like a melting ice cube. You know a speaker from the other conference says that a lot he’s like cash is a melting ice cube, what do you do you put it in Bitcoin. Well, yes, that’s a good idea, but a better idea is something else. So let’s go into the next one.

When we said, when I said we want to just quickly go over what fungibility is. So for those of you who aren’t familiar with fungibility, I’m sure everybody is, but for the benefit of those who are, I don’t know, maybe a lot of my friends, who are watching the live stream, imagine that I was offering you two twenty dollar bills. You would be absolutely indifferent on which one you were gonna get. You wouldn’t care that, you wouldn’t tell me that: “No, I’m only gonna take the 20, which is in your left pocket”. You don’t care which one it is, because they’re both gonna do exactly the same thing. So and that’s what fungibility is — it’s interchangeability, it’s uniformity. Here’s a silly example, but, you know, I think it serves the purpose um if imagine that your dollar bills had a history of what went on and whose hands they exchanged, or whose hands they were in, and imagine it was used previously for drugs, that same dollar bill would be at 72 cents, or put any arbitrary number below one, if it had no unacceptable use most people would accept it at its face value, and if it was previously held by a celebrity, like imagine Kobe Bryant held that dollar bill, you would probably take it and put it in a frame and put it in your living room. So there’s a good reason why every piece of currency is exactly the same as another one, and that’s fungibility. And it’s a very important concept when it comes to money as we’ll see. Go ahead.

So these are the six properties of money: durability, portability, acceptability, it’s widely acceptable, divisibility, scarcity, and fungibility. So cash has all of them, except scarcity. So when we saw the hockey stick in the M1 and M2 money printing charts, you know, you can see that cash is definitely not scarce. And when cash is not scarce what you have in your bank account is losing value on a daily basis. Go ahead.

However let’s try and see what’s good about cash. There are a lot of benefits that come with holding cash as well: it’s private and secure, there’s no data leakage, it’s just the two parties that exchange that cash that know what happened with it, what you purchased with it. If you’re using a Visa or a Mastercard they know exactly who sold you what and all of the details associated with it. With cash you don’t have the data leakage, there’s no third-party involvement, there’s no debt — it’s instant settlement, immediate access to funds, and no associated cost — there’s no like three percent fees associated with cash. Next.

So now let’s think about what could those little chunks of food, vegetable or meat, be, that you could have in your, you know, portfolio or in your sort of custody that would maintain that value so that your soup wouldn’t, you know, spill out if the water was being trickled into it. There’s not that many. So raise your hands if you believe we live in a digital age. Exactly. So whatever becomes money has to be a digital currency. We’re not going to go back to exchanging gold coins. So when we talk about moving into the digital era we are looking to identify the best money that we can identify. Now Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, famously coined the, you know, the term of the blockchain trilemma, what he says is that blockchains have to sacrifice either decentralization, scalability, or security, most of them end up sacrificing one of these three. Well, what we are saying here is that a blockchain should not only make absolutely no trade-off in decentralization, security, and scalability, but in addition a good money, a blockchain that, you know, hopes to become money and widely accepted money, should also have fungibility and scarcity. There’s no negotiation on those five qualities that a digital money should, you know, should contain. Next slide, please.

So, known to us and known to man there’s literally just two things that satisfy all of the qualities of money: durability, portability, although gold suffers a little bit in this area, widely acceptable, divisible, scarce, and fungible. Both of these gold and Monero, in the digital sphere, are, you know, the two things that satisfy all of the properties of money. So what we see now is Bitcoin definitely is not fungible, I think we know that for sure, there’s literally no debating that, but the handicap of gold is the portability. So when we move into the digital age, there’s just one money, a good money, that we have ahead of us and that’s Monero. And most investors don’t know that, and Monero sells for 200 dollars on the market. So, please, next slide.

So a fungible digital asset which is scarce and decentralized like Monero makes for an extremely good investment. Monero is mined on the RandomX protocol, so it’s ASIC resistant, so it’s truly, truly decentralized, it’s not like Bitcoin where you have multi-million dollar farms, it’s actually, you know, anybody, any of us can mine Monero at home on a CPU, which is brilliant, that was Satoshi’s dream. It’s scalable, it has a dynamic block size, and it has security, because it’s got a built-in tail emission. So in addition to all of this, which is Vitalik’s three characteristics  of the blockchain trilemma, Monero also satisfies fungibility and scarcity. Next, plase.

This is the Monero supply chart, I’m sure a lot of you are familiar with this. Bitcoin is the darker one and, Monero is the yellow one. Monero is more scarce than Bitcoin until 2014. And then it starts going up, but it’s going to be, it’s tail emission is about to begin, I think in a few weeks, and the security that the miners need, that means they’re going to have a constant flow of rewards, is extremely important to maintain the security of the blockchain, which is why a good money has to have a tail emission or like a constant supply in a small amount. Monero supply is actually, Monero’s annual emission is actually lower than the supply of gold. You know when the gold prices go up, gold miners start mining more gold. Monero miners cannot do that. And the level of the amount of Monero that hits the market every year is less than the inflation rate of gold. So, go ahead.

This is Monero user spending habits. I don’t think it tells you much. So that’s how it should be. In a cash transaction the seller and the buyer are the only two parties that need to know what was purchased and what was sold, what was transacted. And Monero it maintains that to this day. Go ahead.

This is a map of Monero miner’s location, miners and users location. Again I don’t think it says much. Go ahead.

So Monero has been delisted for most major exchanges, and we don’t think that’s a bad thing. If they were able to contain Monero they wouldn’t delist it, because what they’re doing with Bitcoin is they are adapting it, they’re earning profits from it while they’re fueling a narrative that it’s a rebellious thing to hold, where it’s completely not. It’s completely been co-opted, but they don’t want you to know that. But with Monero it’s not been co-opted, I don’t think, and the reason we know that is because of all of these delistings, I mean the whole page is full. I could have filled three slides full of delistings. So Monero’s only actively traded on a few large exchanges as of today. So the next slide, please.

The future of cryptocurrency is on decentralized exchanges and a person-to-person, you know, transactions. Some of the benefits of DEXes is that they’re KYC free, they maintain data privacy and security better than a centralized exchange, there’s a lower hacking risk, because assets reside on your wallet until they’re exchanged, the user controls private keys at all times, faster and lower fees than a lot of the centralized exchanges, less vulnerability on hackings, open source code, truly censorship resistant, and trustless. The largest DEX today is Uniswap. It’s an ETH-based DEX, but we see a lot of other decentralized exchanges coming in the Bitcoin space, the Hodl Hodl, Bisq and others. and Monero has its own DEX now, that’s about to come on the market soon, and I think this is the future where we’re looking to have probably dozens of such exchanges that would be an ideal scenario. Next, please.

Final thoughts. The separation of money and state achieved by an apolitical, math-based, universally accepted currency with cash-like functionality is necessary in the chaotic world that we live in. There was a time in the history of man when the separation of religion from state was considered absolutely taboo. We’re at a stage in, you know, the history of mankind where we’re approaching this stigmatizing subject of whether money should be, you know, disconnected from the state, and it’s that time. It’s that time to ask that question, and it’s that time to move in that direction. It’s not going to be so taboo in some time, or I think a few decades from now whatever, when we look back at this time this is going to be the time that you know the detachment happened. And I think it’s really, really important, because the state is, when things are given in the hands of the state, there’s only one way — they mess it up. And that’s what they’re, you know, the first half of the presentation was all about how they’ve messed it up. Our lives are impacted by their bad decisions. So what we have to do is in the two bowls of soup we need to take our liquidy soup and convert it into a more physical soup. That’s the only way to get through this. Next, please. Oh, yeah, this is it. Thank you very much. I don’t know if we have time for a question or two until that gets here. Any questions, yeah?

_**Audience:**_ I have a question for you. If tonight I give you 1 billion USD, fiat currency, however you can only use it on two things: it’s a physical gold or Monero? You can only buy one of those. And you have to hold them for 10 years, but after 10 years you can liquid, you can liquidize it by whatever you want. Which one you will buy with a 1 billion USD fiat currency I give you tonight. Gold or Monero? Thank you.

_**Doug:**_ Now you ought to marry me.

_**Nam:**_ You just talked about my two favorite assets. You know that you cannot choose between your children right? I have two boys, I love them equally, I don’t think I can answer that. It’s a very difficult question, I’m sorry. I mean they’re so important, the two of them, like literally you saw the chart — there’s nothing in the world that is, I don’t know, that comes close to either of those two, maybe silver, but… Yeah, because silver evaluations are very low.

_**Audience:**_ […]

_**Nam:**_ Okay, that’s a good question. You know gold has a 5 000 year history. And I’m Indian. Thank you, I’m sure you understand. I don’t know maybe we have time for another one? Do we? Okay, okay, I know he was gonna say that. Anybody else have a question? No?

_**Audience:**_ Thank you. I just wanted to share that I believe that FED, and I probably most people agree that the FED is intentionally creating this inflation to basically impoverish the population and enslave the mankind. So what I’m asking is based on that, you know, premise. Don’t you think that this will persist even with the ups and downs that we expect, and you’re a lot of your speeches about, you know, the inverted yield curve and a potential crash, but what I’m trying to assess is they might have little hiccups but overall they want that inflation to persist. And I wanted to see if, you know, how you felt about that position?

_**Nam:**_ You’re saying if are we gonna have little hiccups or are we gonna have a real crash where things change a lot? Okay, we haven’t seen that yet but coming to the first part, the inflation is definitely a feature and not a bug. So that trickle of water that I talked about that is always going to happen to your soup. Every single morning you’re gonna wake up and that you’re to see more drops in your soup and that dilution with water which has absolutely no nutrition that’s always going to enter your soup, which means your savings are getting diluted every single day, every single day you leave them in the bank, your savings are getting diluted. So the only way to hold on to your savings is converting them into real assets. Literally that’s the only way. Now, we have a problem. Why do we have a problem? Because we have a cost of living increase beyond what we’ve ever seen. So we do need cash. Cash is the only asset that allows us to quickly convert into, you know, food and energy, and whatever else we might need. Having said that, the crash that is possibly eminent here doesn’t seem like anything we’ve ever seen before. So when the recession does occur, it’s gonna hurt a lot of people. And I don’t think… it’s like you said it might be a few hiccups. but I think it’s gonna be like a major crash, when it does happen, and then we’re entering the hyperinflationary phase, where a loaf of bread is a hundred dollars or fifty dollars. I mean, I don’t get into those terminology so much, I see a gradual loss of purchasing power for the common man to the point where it starts tilting and going straight up like a hockey stick, and then we see the hyperinflation. So everything that comes in between, like a temporary stagflation, I think it’ll all be very temporary. I think we’re heading towards the hyperinflation scenario whether we like it or not, because they like you said it’s all designed, they’re crashing the system by design, so yeah.

_**Doug:**_ Guys like I gotta drop just because we gotta keep it going. Thank you so much, Nam, that was amazing.
